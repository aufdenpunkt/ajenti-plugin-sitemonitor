Site monitor
============

Version: 0.1


Description
-----------
Simple configurable Ajenti widget to check if a website is up. Just enter your
domain and the rest will be done by the widget. Currently there are only http
requests possible.



Installation
------------
Navigate to your Ajenti plugins directory (e.g. /var/lib/python-support/python2.7/ajenti/plugins) and execute the following commands:

    $ git clone https://gitlab.com/ajenti/plugin-sitemonitor.git sitemonitor
    $ service ajenti restart (as root or sudo user)



Roadmap
-------
- Add checkbox config to switch between 'http://' and 'https://' requests
